Through the process of completing this project, I was very keen on learning how to make .ajax calls to grab data from the OpenWeather API. In terms of website functionallity, this skill makes creating a website go beyond using just static data; it excites me that it is possible to apply potentially changing data that will dynamically change over time based off of variables outside of my input/control. I'm excited to find more api's to apply to my future projects!
